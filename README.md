For a functional requirement: I'd put a story as "As a user, I would like the search bar to work consistenly, so that I can spend less time looking for courses". It seems like it isn't normalizing the casing or something so when you search for something like "Dynamics" you get no results, but when you search for "dynamics" you get results.

For a quality requirement I'd say something like "usability", the page itself is cold, unfamiliar, and does not give much feedback as to what is going on/failed.
